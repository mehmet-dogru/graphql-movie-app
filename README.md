This GitHub repository contains a basic project developed using Node.js and GraphQL. The project demonstrates how to create a structure using the GraphQL data query language to manage the relationship between movies and directors.

# Project Content
Movie Data: Each movie has attributes such as its name, release date, and director.
Director Information: Data about directors, including their names, birthdates, and filmographies, is also stored in this project.

GraphQL Queries: In this project, you can query movies and directors using GraphQL queries. This allows you to fetch the data you need from the database and avoid unnecessary data traffic.

GraphQL Schemas and Relationships: The project teaches you how to define GraphQL schemas and manage the relationship between movies and directors. This simplifies data structure organization and querying.

# Using GraphQL
Using GraphQL in our project, you can perform the following tasks:

  - Query movie information
  - Query director information
  - Understand and utilize the relationships between movies and directors

This project serves as a fundamental resource to put GraphQL into practice and helps you query your data more effectively.
